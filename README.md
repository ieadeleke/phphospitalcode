This is a minimalistic Hospital code which is meant to register each person in the Hospital under a category. The code can be tested by

Installing XAMMP or WAMP server so as to run the PHP file.
Cloning or downloading the source codes of the different pages
Running the code on a local machine
The starting point of the code is the index.php page which serves as the Registration Page. After successful registration, the user is redirected to the Log In Page and upon successful sign in, he or she is shown the approprate page based on their Access Level.

The Website Admin can register new users into the database.

For testing purposes, a user can select to be registered as a Super Admin on the Registraion Page. A feature that would surely be removed if it were to be on a live server
